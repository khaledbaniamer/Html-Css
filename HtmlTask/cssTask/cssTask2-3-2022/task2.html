    <h1>Pokemon</h1>
    <p>
        All of the licensed Pokémon properties overseen by The Pokémon Company are divided roughly by generation.
         These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; when an official sequel in the main role-playing
          game series is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and possibly new gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise. The main games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins. The franchise began its eighth and current generation with Pokémon Sword and Shield, which were  <span>released worldwide for the</span>Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.
